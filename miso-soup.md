# 15-Minute Miso Soup with Greens and Tofu

## Ingredients

- 2 cups vegetable broth (use dashi for more traditional miso soup // see notes above)
- 0.5 sheet nori (dried seaweed // optional // cut into large rectangles // 1 sheet yields 1/4 cup)
- 1.5-2 Tbsp white or yellow miso paste (fermented soy bean or chickpea paste) with or without bonito (fish flavor, though bonito makes it non vegan-vegetarian-friendly)
- 0.25 cup chopped green chard or other sturdy green
- 0.25 cup chopped green onion
- 0.13 cup firm tofu (cubed // use silken tofu for more traditional miso soup)

## Preparation

1. Place vegetable broth in a medium sauce pan and bring to a low simmer.
1. In the meantime, place miso (starting with lesser end of range) into a small bowl, add a little hot water and whisk until smooth. This will ensure it doesnâ€™t clump when added to the soup later. Set aside.
1. To the broth add chard (or other greens of choice), green onion, and tofu (if using silken, add at the end of cooking) and cook for 5 minutes. Then add nori and stir. Remove from heat, add miso mixture, and stir to combine.
1. Taste and add more miso or a pinch of sea salt if desired. Serve warm. Best when fresh.
